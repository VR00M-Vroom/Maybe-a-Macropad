# August 10th
The seeds of my idea  havebeen planted in the form of the schematic. The idea was to make 9 key macropad with a I2C Display. The microcontroller would be a Seeed Studios Xiao RP2040
as the MCU. Then there would be 9 lights for each button.
I have just got into the designing part and cant find the right footprint for the leds and the right footprint for the I2C display... Oh how I hat importing files into kicad.
Most of the schematic is done but I chose the wrong I2C display module which makes it even more frustrating since im 2hrs in alr. Hope is all I can last on now... Probably DM soemone about the problem in slack

Time Spent ~3hrs

The grind begins.
I got a Dm back from someone who gave me the footprint and the symbol for the display which saved me another five hours. I mean 5 hrs to download a kicad file is wild.
Anyways the projects file for the led was still horribly wrogn and took me an hour to figure out. The schematic changed from 9 to 6 leds and 8 switches. The 8 switches was fora cleaner alignment and different layout. The led matrix was a idea still in progress but it was none the less progress on my behalf.
